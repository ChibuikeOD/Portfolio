# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This application is built with Streamlit and serves as a centralized hub to showcase my skills in data visualization, machine learning, and interactive web application development.

It currently features the following projects:

### Data Visualization
- **Car Data Analysis**: An interactive dashboard exploring vehicle performance metrics using Altair.
- **Co-Authorship Network**: A force-directed graph visualization of academic co-authorship using D3.js.
- **Contour Analysis**: A medical imaging tool for visualizing CT scan density contours.

### Machine Learning
- **Used Car Price Prediction**: A machine learning application that predicts car prices based on user inputs.
- **Audio Deepfake Detection**: A multimodal system for detecting AI-generated audio artifacts.
- **Edge-Deployed Neural Networks**: Research on deploying quantized neural networks to FPGAs.
- **Voice-Automated AI Chatbot**: A VR-integrated AI assistant powered by fine-tuned LLMs.
